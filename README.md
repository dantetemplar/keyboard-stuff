# My keyboard layouts

Currently I'm using Carpalx [QGMLWB](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/?full_optimization) fully optimized layout. 
However, I've encountered Copy-Paste issue (Ctrl, V are too far from each other), so I decided to redefine virtual keys for layots:
- `QGMLWB` layer will send virtual `vkQ`, `vkG`, `vkM`, `vkL`, `vkW`, `vkB`... except `F`, `N`, `V` keys;
  - `F` will send `vkV`, `N` will send `vkF`, `V` will send `vkN`;
- `ЙЦУКЕН` layer will send virtual `vkQ`, `vkG`, `vkM`, `vkL`, `vkW`, `vkB`... except `М`, `А`, `Щ` keys;
  - `М` will send `vkV`, `А` will send `vkF`, `Щ` will send `vkN`;
- This remapping saves same positional `QWERTY` shortcut for `Ctrl+V`, `Ctrl+F` (and also other shortcuts related to `V`, `F` keys);
- Also position of `vkN` moved to `QGMLWB` V key or `QWERTY` P key... Be careful... 
- Other shortcuts will be respect to `QGMLWB`;
- Same positioning between my `QGMLWB` and my `ЙЦУКЕН` layouts.
